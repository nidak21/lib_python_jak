# Misc Shell Utilities and Python Libraries that Jim Uses

bin:      Misc shell & python scripts that should work on most versions of Unix,
          but mostly these have been used/tested on Mac OS X.
          
          The Install script installs these in a bin directory

lib/python: Misc python utility modules
          The Install script installs these in a lib/python directory

dotFiles: "dot" files that generally should be installed in your home dir
          with the "dot" converted by ".".
          E.g., "dotbash_profile -> .bash_profile

          The Install script does not touch these, you need to install these
          by hand.

Examples: Example scripts and snippets of code to remind me of how to do 
          certain things. Some of these are pretty out of date.
          These are not installed anywhere.
