These are old shell utilities that I haven't taken the time to make work.

Some use my old (lost) cptime command which sets the modification time of a
file based on the modification time of another file.
This functionality now exists in:  touch -r file1 file2
(but I was never been sure copying the time was really a good idea)

If I resurrect these, might be good to convert them to bash scripts.
